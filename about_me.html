                        <p>As for me, I'm a UX Engineer with experience in both design and development. I'm currently in an undergrad program for User
                            Experience and Interaction Design. This has been really helpful for me to learn more about how to create an experience that 
                            really supports the user and makes them feel satisfied.</p>
                        <p>IIn my free time, I love playing the violin, cooking and eating, and playing video games. Other than that, I love to learn 
                            about new things and I'm always watching videos about pretty much anything from cooking a recipe to the history of HTML to 
                            the ins and outs of life beyond earth (a fun but somewhat depressing topic)!</p>
