    <p class="one">I'm Parker Nix, a second-year undergrad student in the IDM program at Drexel University. I've just started coding, and this very 
        website is my first shot at it! So far, I feel like I've been able to grasp the basics, and I'd be ready to apply the knowledge 
        I gained from building this portfolio page to a different kind of website. I love food and cooking, and I also like trying new 
        things! I like to think I'm a bit of a wild card.</p>
    <p>Aside from this, I also play the Violin. I've been playing for about ten years now and I was even in a major for it in 
        middle school (It was a public school, but they had a program where you'd go to the school for a specific art major). I used 
        to think I'd want to have a career in music, but I pretty quickly changed my mind because there are so many other options and 
        it just didn't feel like the right choice for me somehow. Still, I love playing and I'm currently in Drexel's orchestra, which 
        has been a great place to keep working on getting better.</p>
    <p>In high school, I also was part of an arts program, under the film major. I did find some enjoyment in cinematography and 
        editing and all, but again, it just didn't feel like my thing. My brother is going to be graduating from Drexel, and he's in the 
        film program here. He's definitely much better with all that stuff than I am, but I at least know my way around a few of the Adobe 
        programs and I can probably(?) get a good shot or two.</p>
    <p>As for experience with coding, I can't say I have too much other than this project. I've messed around with it here and there, 
        but I still feel really new to the whole thing. My dad did some studying with a few books and some other resources, so he's also 
        showed me a few things. We also had a few lessons about it in our film program (at some point it became the "Film and New Media" 
        major, but I was a senior at that point), but to be quite honest I don't remember much about it other than that we were using 
        Processing. However, after coding this project, I think I have a better understanding of the process to get a website up and running.</p>
