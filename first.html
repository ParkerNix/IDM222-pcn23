      <p>For this project, we were to create a proper prototype for a website, and for me the website in question was Gamepress, 
        A site for mobile games with an emphasis on strategy. My focus was on the Pokemon Go portion of the page, since the whole site 
        was a bit big.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Sitemap</h2>

        To start, I was instructed to do a case study with about three people and use the information gleaned off of that to make a
        sitemap to illustrate the general structure of the site. I had trouble finding people to do this project, as I still had
        yet to really make solid friends (first term nerves and all that). Luckily I was able to get over it and get some 
        results anyhow. This was also when I realized that web design software can be a little pricey. The site I used to make my 
        sitemap was good; it made it easy to line things up and make a simple looking map. However, they also had some high costs 
        on services. Thankfully, I was okay to buy it, but it made me realize that Web Designers get paid so well for a reason, 
        apparently.</p>

    <h2>Wireframes and I: A Rough Relationship</h2>

    <p>Next it was time to come up with some ideas for wireframes. This wasn't too bad, as I could do it on paper. This meant I 
        could just draw it up when inspiration hit. This would have been nice, had inspiration decided to hit a bit more often than 
        it did. This lead to me spending many days just trying to figure out what to put down. Eventually, I ended up filling the 
        page with ideas that only slightly iterated from each other. This lead into the final prototype of the new Gamepress, which 
        I have to say came out pretty well for my first shot at UX design. I think I was most successful at coming up with creative 
        ideas, but one thing I needed then (and could always use now) is to figure out a way to have these ideas without wasting so 
        much time.</p>
