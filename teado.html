  <h1>Redesigning Tea-Do</h1>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>Our task</h2>

    <p>For this project, My group and I were to collaborate to prototype a redesign for a website. We chose to do our project on a 
      website for the bubble tea restaurant, Tea-Do. We wanted to gather test research on how the website functioned for the user so 
      we could build our design around fixing the issues testers had with the site.</p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>

    <p>      
      We used Usertesting.com to create our test. We wanted to ask the user to do things that would be close to what a normal user 
      would go on the website for. Thus, we asked them to do things like looking at a menu, finding a drink, and getting information 
      on their locations. Through these tests, we found that the website was really confusing for users, especially when it came to 
      finding locations and reading the menu. The testers did, however, like the general feel of the website and thought it got to the 
      point quickly without things being in the way.</p>

    <p>Going off of this information, we got to work on creating the prototype. We had pretty good teamwork and we were able to get
      through the work with relative ease (though it may have gone a bit late into the night). We decided it would be a good idea 
      to add an order menu for people to put in an order online, as well as a contact page where you could find their social accounts 
      and send an email to the business. We also redesigned the menus to show the prices, and in the ordering service, you would be 
      able to see the ingredients, both of which were pain points for the testers. From this process, I learned a lot about how to 
      work with a team to get a quality result, as well as how to best research how users use a website.</p>
